# What does this Repo Contain

This Repo Contains 2 Notebook that showcases the testing that the CV CoP has tested.
A recommended way to test them is using Google Colab since it provides free GPU which will greatly enhance the execution time.
(Having said that it is not mandatory).

This Repo also contains a presentation that explains more about CLIP showcasing results. (Information are found in the speaker's notes)
